        <p>In this blog, I'll pretend that I am discussing topics below to a non-technical friend.</p>
        <h6>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h6>
        <p><strong>HTML</strong> is like a newly built 3 bedroom house. All the timbers and concrete still fresh and exposed.</p>
        <p><strong>CSS</strong> comes when you paint the house with the color of your desire. The land that the house stands on has a landscape, beautiful plants and trees.
        Inside the house where it has paintings on the walls, could be wallpaper with it. Designer furniture on the living area and colorful lights on some parts of the house.</p>

        <h6>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h6>
        <p>On everyday life, we do have control flow that we do. These are when we notice that the rubbish on the kitchen are full, then we take the rubbish away to the rubbish bin to be collected by the truck once everyweek. If we ran out of dishwashing soap, then we go to supermarket and buy one.
        Another is when we have free time, then we watch tv, play computer games, or go out with friends.</p>
        <p>Loops that we do on everyday life are, when we go to work everyday. Taking a shower, cooking 3x a day.</p>

        <h6>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h6>
        <p>DOM is the face of HTML webpage. It defines logical structure of documents which can be accessed and manipulated.</p>
        <p>We can interact with it by for instance, if we want to change the properties of an element by accessing its object model.</p>

        <h6>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h6>
        <p>Think of those data on each arrays as ordered numbers. Your count starts from 0 on the first data. If we have an array <code>month["January", "February", "March", "April"]</code>. If we want March to be accessed, then we will have <code>month[2]</code>. We can store the data to variable for example <code>var mnth = month[2]</code>.</p>
        <p>Objects on the other hand. Think of an object like person that has properties on it. Example below</p>
        <p><code>var person = {<br>
        &nbsp&nbspfirstName: "John",<br>
        &nbsp&nbsplastName: "Doe",<br>
        &nbsp&nbspage: 50,<br>
        &nbsp&nbspeyeColor: "blue"<br>
        };</code></p>

        <p>If we need to know how old is John. Two ways to do it, We can use "." on it like <code>person.age</code> or we can use "[]" like <code>person[age]</code>. We can then use a variable to store the age to like <code>var age = person.age</code> or <code>var age = person[age]</code>.</p>

        <h6>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h6>
        <p>Functions are like routines. For example, if we sell something. Every item we sold, we have to make a receipt. Every service we deliver, we make a receipt. When we make a receipt, we do it from the start, typing all the details onto paper. So for every sell or service we do, we make a receipt which is too long to make.</p>
        <p>Function comes into play where we save a copy template of receipt then we can use it  after we sold or provide service without creating receipts from start.</p>
