        <h6>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h6>

        <h6>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h6>
        <p>I have been on IT support for more than 7 years. Since then I feel like I'm stuck on that role and not growing. From previous employer where they made entire team redundant (including me) and after a few months got a service desk role here in auckland. When on that same role but different culture and environment. I found out that my colleagues and my mentor is not quite happy about what has going on with their career. Some of them been on service desk role for more than 3 years, one person been on that role since the company started. A couple of weeks when I started the role, I feel I'm not fit for the team, knowing that I should be on a senior role already but not given a chance by previous employers. Too different culture and I struggle to fit in. Maybe its because that they are moving at a very fast pace and competition style environment. When I was buddying up with someone, I got a chance to ask questions about them working in the company. Found out that they are really not happy on what's going on, some of them are planning to look for another job in a few months time. Before me, there was more employees who already left because either they are not happy, not into the company's culture and no or very limited career progression.</p>

        <p>Since then, I started to think like imposter syndrome. I experienced stress on that role. After that, I was thinking of moving to another career, and that career is on development role.</p>

        <p>Couple of years ago, I started to think of going to development role but don't know how. After a month, I decided to look for a school, got accepted after then I spoke to the manager about me resigning to the role. I explained that I was stressed and the role is not for me anymore. If I continue then the team would suffer with regards to performance. I told the manager that I am not happy anymore and I want a career change. He understands it and accepted my resignation.</p>

        <p>Since then, I feel lighter and looking forward on what comes at me.</p>

        <h6>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h6>
        <p>Not entirely sure on where to begin on this part. I assume that the culture you're asking is from the country where I grew from. Hence, I will summarise our culture as best as I can.</p>
        <p>Filipino's are: resilient, families first, very religious, very respectful, help one another, value traditions and culture, love to party, love to eat, love to sing, love art and architecture.</p>
        <p>I found this lists from the this <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/philippines/articles/11-things-you-should-know-about-the-filipino-culture/">website</a> and I found it summarises all the qualities that we value.</p>
        <p>I can relate these qualities that influence my values and identity below.<br>
        <strong>Resilient</strong> - If its not working, I find a way, I research, build a sandbox, I ask my colleagues and friends until it works.<br>
        <strong>Families first</strong> - It is self-explenatory but yes, I do prioritise family.<br>
        <strong>Very Religious</strong> - Not really that very much but I believe in one creator. I also set aside one day every week for church.<br>
        <strong>Very Respectful</strong> - I respect everyone anywhere. Whether its their opinion, actions, culture, sex, religion and many more.<br>
        <strong>Help one another</strong> - If I am free and usually I am when someones in need. I have this passion of helping people.<br>
        <strong>Value traditions</strong> - We have our own traditions and I also embrace other traditions in new zealand <br>
        <strong>Love to party</strong> - Who doesn't, we and I love going to if invited. For me, it's a must to recharge.<br>
        <strong>Love to eat</strong> - This is given, it is a must.<br>
        <strong>Love to sing</strong> - Yeah, we do, although music doesn't like me, but I do participate for the crowd.<br>
        <strong>Love art and architecture</strong> - On my mind, there is art and architecture hiding from outside. I used to apply this ideas in my mind by building DIY projects.</p>

        <p>There are heaps of culture and values but I think above sticks all else.</p>

        <h6>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h6>

        <h6>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h6>
        <p>Based on my previous role.</p>
        <p>High on resourcefulness, collaboration, documentation, communication, empathy, mindfulness, team-work</p>
        <p>Limited on time, planning, journaling</p>
        <h6>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h6>
        <p>Resourcefulness and documentation might hinder because of time constraint and communication.</p>
        <h6>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
          Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now,
          and why.</h6>
        <p>When I was a SAP ABAP Developer, we have this process starting from user's request contacting functional team, functional team makes documentation and requirements then approved, documentation passed to development team to assess and create a program as requested.
        After program creation, developer then to alpha test, if all passed according to requirements, will be transported to QAS where functional team to beta test as user. If all goes well, document will be signed off then will be transported to production.</p>
        <p>But not all projects went successfully to that process as sometimes, user's wants to add more features in the middle of project phase. This creates additional communications time-frames, document to sign-off again and heaps of testing which delays the project timeline.</p>
        <p>Because this happens frequently specially on near go-live schedule. We as a team would sit-down with a user representative and would work as developer-user instead of developer-functional-user.
        Developer-functional-user sometimes there's a problem in between with communication. And usually the resistance is between developer and functional. There's one instance that the requirements is not documented properly as per user requests.     </p>
        <p>At the end, the transition between developer-user is much faster, we understand clearly on what user wants directly and testing results came back from user's in an instant. Once the project is done, and user thinks its ok, we then update the documentation and notify the functional team and approval team for the update. We received lesser complaints with this process.</p>
