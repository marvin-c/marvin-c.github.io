        <h6>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h6>

        <h6>Got blocked on a simple problem</h6>
        <p>I was cleaning my room, cleaned computer table and I untanggled all the cables, unplugged everything. After cleaning and get rid of the rubbish. I arranged things on the table. Organised cables and connected to my computer. Took a shower, got refreshments and return to room.
        Opened my computer and my computer didn't turned on. I quickly checked everything, all seems connected to the right place. Monitor does have light lit on but no display. Getting frustrated as I have checked everything, and I believe all have been returned to the way it was after orginizing the cables.</p>
        <p>It took me whole afternoon to figure out what has happened. I have to trace back what I have disconnected and reconnected again seems doesn't work. I'm thinking my computer must have gave up but I can't believe it.
        I was so frustrated and decided to take a walk. While I was walking outside to get some fresh air, I noticed that there's a man trying to turn on his electric mower. I stopped and asked him what's going on? He said that his mower just stopped in the middle of his mowing. He then returned to garage and saw his toddler playing with the switch on the power mains.
        When I knew what happened, I quickly returned home and checked the power cable on my computer plugged on switched off power outlet. All has been resolved after I switched on the mains.</p>


        <h6>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h6>
        <p>When I was at my friends place. He asked me if I could fix his sound system. He has a 7.1 channel speakers connected to his main amplifier. His amplifier is hooked up to his 50" LCD TV.
        He said he tried to connect things but the amp doesn't work.</p>

        <p>I checked and noticed that cables are everywhere from tv, down to main amplifier. I disconnected all cables from his tv, main amp and speakers. I asked him for the manual which he provided to me. Labelled all cables according to the manual, connected the cables to the right terminals and organised it.
        All is working now after reorganising and connecting to the right places.</p>

        <h6>In both cases:</h6>

        <h6>What was the problem?</h6>
        <p>Not being organised and quick to solve the problem without checking everything else.</p>

        <h6>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h6>
        <p>Methodological, search for resource, taking notes, trying something, asking for help, improving process with reflection.</p>

        <h6>How did you feel throughout the process?</h6>
        <p>Very helpful.

        <h6>What did you learn?</h6>
        <p>When things go wrong, try something different or talk to anyone just to untanggle thoughts of discouragement and frustration.</p>

        <h6>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h6>

        <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> - For now, needs improvement, constant practise and need to get involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Trying something</strong> - confident</p>
        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - confident</p>
        <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong> - For now, need to get improvement and understanding.</p>
        <p><strong>Console.logging</strong> - confident</p>
        <p><strong>Googling</strong> - Very confident, this is the top resource and most of the time I use.</p>
        <p><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - Doesn't always apply as I always use googling first, but I do ask if really stuck.</p>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - Haven't tried yet, but will use this on the bootcamp.</p>
        <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - Still work on progress. Lots of things that I haven't realised but I am working on it.</p>
