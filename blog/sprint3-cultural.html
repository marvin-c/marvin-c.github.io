        <h6>Research EQ and IQ - Keep your answers on a document which you will later turn into a blog post.</h6>

        <h6>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h6>
        <p>It's about the ability to reason and solve problems based on the emotions we experience. In other words, an emotionally intelligent person is aware of emotions in him/herself and others and uses reason to identify, understand, and deal with the emotions effectively.</p>

        <h6>How is it different to IQ?</h6>
        <p>While E.I. is all about how a person reflects and understand their own and otherâ€™s emotions, to differentiate between them, and to use that knowledge to guide your actions and behaviors. I.Q. on the other hand is about brain strength, measuring things like math, logic, and verbal strength. Like any skill, it can be developed with some heavy mental weight lifting</p>

        <h6>Why is it important?</h6>
        <p>IQ is still recognized as an important element of success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement. People with high IQs typically to do well in school, often earn more money, and tend to be healthier in general. But today experts recognize it is not the only determinate of life success. Instead, it is part of a complex array of influences that includes emotional intelligence among other things.</p>
        <p>Research has found that individuals with strong leadership potential also tend to be more emotionally intelligent, suggesting that a high EQ is an important quality for business leaders and managers to have.</p>
        <p>Life success is a result of many factors. Both IQ and EQ undoubtedly play roles in influencing your overall success, as well as things such as health, wellness, and happiness. Rather than focusing on which factors might have a more dominant influence, the greatest benefit may lie in learning to improve skills in multiple areas.

        In addition to strengthening certain cognitive abilities, such as your memory and mental focus, you can also acquire new social and emotional skills that will serve you well in many different areas of your life.</p>
