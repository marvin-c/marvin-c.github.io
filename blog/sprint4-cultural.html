        <h6>Research Neuroplasticity</h6>

        <h6>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h6>
        <p>Understanding the principles have its benefits for people and listed below as what I think.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It brings a mindset of we can actually change and rewire ourselves to learn other things.</li>
          <li>Changes the way how we think.</li>
          <li>Put an effort and we can learn a new skill.</li>
          <li>Practise and more practise puts a foundation of a new skill possibly a second nature.</li>
          <li>The process of what and how we learn can be used to learn another new skill.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h6>
        <p>Engaging on principles will benefit me by being more productive in anything I do. Easier for me to learn another skill as I am familiar of what and how I get to learn.
        I will have an open mind to learning. I will be having a growth mindset. Finding ways to solve a problem. </p>

        <h6>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Practise</li>
          <li>Meditation</li>
          <li>Listening</li>
          <li>Collaborating</li>
          <li>Doing Challenges</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Excercising</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Research Growth Mindset</h6>

        <h6>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h6>
        <p>Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others)</p>

        <p>This will be relevant as we journey to learning web development. We need to have a good strategy on our learning capabilities, practice on what we learn and embrace feedback from others.</p>

        <h6>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h6>
        <p>No. In my IT career, learning is constant. Feedback from customers is vital to either continue or improve service provided and hardwork to accomplish things.</p>

        <h6>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h6>
        <p>By learning through reading, going to meet-ups, participate in related events, have break and fun when stuck on something, provide and absorb feedbacks and practise practise practise.</p>

        <h6>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h6>
        <h6>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h6>
        <p>Before when I just finished my degree course and started on my first employment. I realised that school education is not the end of learning, but it is where you are being prepared on how to become resourceful and find ways to learn. During my first employment, that was the time I learned to have growth mindset. Back then, I didn't know what it is.</p>

        <p>I was in a new enviroment, no knowledge of the technology that I will be using, new colleagues and time schedule. All of these changes for me was very hard. But I prepared myself to learn, to adjust and to be reselient. I formulate my learning strategy, but back then, my strategy was not always working for me. I use to improvise and/or change it and that makes me flexible. I read books a lot about the technology I am using, researched and practised a lot. Time was not always friendly however, it has all worked for me, that's because of the hard work that I have been through.</p>

        <p>Feedbacks helped me to get through as well. It helps shape my strategy and as a result, I was able to deliver what was required by the company for a short span of time.</p>
