        <h6>Sprint 5 Cultural reflection</h6>
        <p><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>First. You can learn new skill with hardwork and self discipline. It doesn't matter of what age, sex, culture a person belongs to.</li>
          <!-- <li>Second, work as a team is much better than working alone. Nothing wrong with working alone, however, working alone can get you stuck and unproductive in the long run. Working as a team on the other hand, can get you accomplish things much faster and achieve far beyond than working alone.</li> -->
          <li>Second. Following the process and framework gets your inner most engine run for longer. What I meant is, if you have a problem to solve, without process and framework, chances to become stressed is great and worst is to abandon easily on what has began.</li>
          <li>Third. Everything can be achieved through growth mindset. Just an effort of this changing the state of your mind can get you far. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
        <!-- <p>That I made this far. That I learned to build basic HTML, CSS and Javascript together.</p> -->
        <p>That I am capable of learning just to change my static mindset to growth mindset. Have the belief of achieving things can be done with belief, hardwork and discipline</p>

        <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
        <p>To change the mindset from static to growth mindset.</p>
        <p>When dealing with a problem, it is easily to forget that there is a process and framework that can be followed to make things much easier.</p>
        <!-- <p>Dealing with the code that is not designed by me. Like the minesweeper challenge. For me, it is much easier to troubleshoot codes that is designed by me. But I guess, this will be part also of becomming a web developer, solving problems from other people.</p> -->

        <p><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>With core learning, it helps individual to become more efficient in problem solving.</li>
          <li>Core learning shapes and identifies the individual strengths, values and identity.</li>
          <li>Core learning teaches you on how to be better in Emotional Intelligence</li>
          <li>Core learning sets your mind to have growth mindset</li>
          <li>Also, it teaches you how valuable it is to care and listen consciously to other people. I believe this skill is important to have when dealing with clients on this career.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>I learned a lot in studying core learning. When I was a developer before. I didn't realise that some of the tasks I did way back then is well documented on this core learning exercises.</p>
        <p>One particular task that I did back then was listening to end users. Listening to their complaints, their requests and requirements. Back then, it is important that the information you got from the end users must be implimented on the project or else, the project will not be used.</p>
        <p>This task that I did back then was in the core learning Listening and Looping exercise. </p>
        <p>Core learning is as important to know and learn as technical skill and this gave me a valuable time learning it.</p>
