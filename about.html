    <h1>All about me.</h1>
    <p>On my early IT career, I repair electronics and computers. When it comes to Electronics and Computers, I am quickly drawn into it. I was a full-time computer technician while studying in computer science.</p>
    <p>After graduating in Bachelors degree, I became SAP programmer and developer. On this career, I became exposed to projects, functional teams, testing and countless sleepless nights. All those efforts results to more than 5 successfull go-live rollouts which 11 companies.</p>
    <p>Looking for a better life, I decided to migrate in New Zealand and secured an IT Support role which I was very excited.</p>
    <p>Moving on, at present, I decided to change careers as I find development much more challenging and exciting for me.</p>
    <p>Recently I became more interested in Tech and coding.</p>
    <p>I am still passionate in IT support, and I am more excited now that become a coder to be added to my passion list.</p>
    <p>On my past career, I learned a lot on team-work, being resourceful, tech-savy, empathy, kindness, sharing information, initiative helpfulness, colaborate, and how to have fun. Can't wait to merge these skills to the new culture!</p>
